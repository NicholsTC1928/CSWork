-Object oriented programming (O.O.P.) has two parts:
    -Attributes (variables)
    -Actions (methods)

-O.O.P. consists of instance variables (also known as "fields") amd constructors.

-Code Reuse - practice of writing program code once and using it in many contexts

-Is-a Relationship - hierarchical connection between two categories in which one type is a specialized version of the other

-Inheritance (Inherit) - programming technique that allows a derived class to extend the functionality of a base class,
inheriting all of its state and behavior
    -Derived Class (subclass)
    -Parent Class (superclass)

-Override - implement a new version of a method to replace code that would otherwise have been inherited from a
superclass
