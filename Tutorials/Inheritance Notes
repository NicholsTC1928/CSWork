-Interface - type that consists of a set of method declarations; when classes promise to implement an interface, you
can treat those classes similarly in your code

-Abstract Method - method that is declared (as in an interface), but is not implemented; these methods represent the
behavior that a class promises to implement when it implements an interface

-Object-Oriented Design (OOD) - modeling a program or system as a collection of cooperating objects, implemented as a
set of classes using class hierarchies

-Refactoring - changing a program's internal structure without modifying its external behavior to improve simplicity,
readability, maintainability, extensibility, performance, etc.

-Abstract Class - Java class that cannot be instantiated (the "new" keyword), but instead serves as a superclass to hold
common code and declare abstract behavior
