public static void

Public vs. Private:
-Public methods can be used anywhere.
-Private methods can only be used in the class that it is specified in.

When creating a non-static class, you are creating a new instance of the class.
Example:
class shape{
    private drawShape(){
        ...
    }
}

This will only be used by typing:
... = new shape myShape();

When a static is void, it returns nothing. You can replace void with the type of value returned (i.e., int).

final - A value declared as final can never change. (It is considered a constant.)
