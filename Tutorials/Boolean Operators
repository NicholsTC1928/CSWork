There are three types of boolean operators:
    1. && (Logical AND)
    2. || (Logical OR)
    3. ! (Not/Negation)

Here is a table regarding what values are returned for variables p ane q in different tests:

(Please note that "T" stands for "True," while "F" stands for "False.")

p/q   p || q   p && q   !(p || q)   !p   !q   !p && !q
F/F     F        F          T       T    T        T
F/T     T        F          T       T    F        T
T/F     T        F          T       F    T        T
T/T     T        T          F       F    F        F

Note how !(p || q) and !p && !q have the same value. This is known as "De Morgan's Law," and states that these two
will always be equal to each other. Here is a table for De Morgan's Law:

Original Expression / Negated Expression / Simplified Negation
p || q / !(p || q) / !p && !q
p && q / !(p && q) / !p || !q
