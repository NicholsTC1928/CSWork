In Java, there are two types of variables:
    -Reference Variables (objects, arrays, etc.)
    -Value Variables (primitives (int, double, String, etc.))

-If you were to type "int a = 5," then the value of a (5) would be stored in the memory.

-If you were to type "int[] b," then it would point to a location in memory (pointer). This means that
"int[] myArray2 = myArray" would simply make it so that myArray2 would become a reference to myArray1. As a result,
typing "myArray2[x] = y" would also change the (x + 1)th element of myArray to y.

-To make a copy of an array, use the clone method. (For example, if you want to make a copy of integer array a called b,
you would type "int[] b = a.clone().")
