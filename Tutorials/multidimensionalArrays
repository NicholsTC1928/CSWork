Multidimensional Arrays:
    -An array of arrays
    -Example: int[][] numArray = new int[5][4]; would give the following array:
    0 | 0 | 0 | 0
    0 | 0 | 0 | 0
    0 | 0 | 0 | 0
    0 | 0 | 0 | 0
    0 | 0 | 0 | 0
    -As can be seen, the first number in int[5][4] is the number of rows, while the second number is the number of
    columns.
