-Iteration (Iterative) - programming technique in which you describe actions to be repeated using a loop

-Recursion (Recursive) - programming technique in which you describe actions to be repeated using a method that calls
itself

-Base Case - case within a recursive solution that is so simple that it can be solved directly without a recursive call;
it is required to prevent an infinite recursion (recursive equivalent of an infinite loop)

-Recursive Case - case within a recursive solution that involves reducing the overall problem to a simpler problem of the
same kind that can be solved by a recursive call

-Call Stack - internal structure that keeps track of the sequence of methods that have been called
