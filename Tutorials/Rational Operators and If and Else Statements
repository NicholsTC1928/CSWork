Relational Operators (Gives True or False):
    - == - Equal to
    - != - Not Equal to
    - < - Less Than
    - > - Greater Than
    - <= - Less Than or Equal to
    - >= - Greater Than or Equal to

-Relational operators happen after arithmetic equations. For example, "(2 + 2) == 4" would return true.

If Statement Format:
    if([test]){
    [statement];
    [statement];
    ...
    [statement];
    }

-The if statement is a control structure. Here is a diagram representing the flow of one:
[Is the test true?]
    Yes: Execute the controlled statement(s), and then execute the statement(s) after the if statement.
    No: Execute the statement(s) after the if statement.

-Here are some examples of if statements:
    -[z is odd] if(z % 2 != 0)
    -[z is not greater than y's square root] if(z <= (Math.sqrt(y)))
    -[y is positive] if(y >= 0)
    -[y is a multiple of z] if(y % z == 0)
    -[y is a non-negative one-digit number] if(y >= 0 && y <= 9)

-If/else statements allow the testing and execution of any number of control statements. One way to do this is by
nesting them.
